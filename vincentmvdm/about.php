                            <p>
                                Hi! My name is Vincent and I am originally from the Netherlands (which is where the funky accent comes from). I moved to Seattle two years ago to study at the University of Washington. I am in the second year of the Informatics program, which combines design and computer science. I am really excited about the intersection of design and code, and am a product designer who is involved in both the design and development process. Specifically, I love taking products from start to finish, design systems, scalable CSS, and React.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When I am not using my computer, which I admittedly should do more, I like to read nonfiction, run, which I should do more too, and drink coffee. My favorite movies are Forrest Gump and Goodwill Hunting, but then again, I donâ€™t really watch any others. It is a lifelong dream to visit Boston, so if you live there, or just want to say hi, my email is below :-)
                            </p>
                            <div class="mt2">

                            <p>I like to read a fair bit when I have time. No one ever asks me what I'm reading, so I figured I'd put that here:
